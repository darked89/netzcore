- nz sucks when self score is assigned in case of 0 division (due to 0 variance), changed to assign inf/-inf. z-scoring in netzcore is contraversial, since it compares scores coming from different distributions (local neighborhood for each node), now assigning scores based on global distribution of neighboring scores.

- runs on 3 ppi with aneurysm data for preliminary analysis of programs & parameters. Performances do not vary a lot with respect to network. NetShort gives promising results. NetScore and NetZcore is comparable. Furthermore, NetZcore i4,i5,i6 can make a lot of difference since it is sort-of-random whereas performance of NetScore is more stable (i.e. r1i3 vs r2i3 or r3i2)

- Using random subsets of non-seed nodes to get negative score values (for calculating FP/TN). Was using subsets of 10 non-seeds, consequitive runs vary largely, now sampling usibng all non-seeds (N_nonseed / N_seed non_seeds are averaged for each non-negative fold)

- filtered networks with reliability scores (detection method + pubmed > 2) (can also use edge other attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- edge relevance scores coming from string (all vs only co-expression vs exp and db) (more data from tissue info / HEFalMp?) seem to not to improve performance

- using 0.00001 vs 0.01 as default non seed score reduced nz i5 performance on no_tap lcc by 4,5%

- performance with all initial network (not the largest connected component) is ~10% better than lcc ?-> small cc of 6,5,4,3,2 has quite good performances (e.g. all of these proteins in these cc's are associated - need to check)

- checked performance of ori's networks using gaudi: no significan difference using only network / network with coexp / network with coloc but 5% increase when using coexp + coloc also checked 1e-2 vs 1e-5 which yields only about 1% difference.

- checked how seeds are connected with each other (linker degree distribution and ratios of seeds), (see anaylze_network.r generated graphs) for biana_no_tap_no_reliability (ld>10/11 and rld2 > 60/65 % seems well seperator for some of the seeds

- Some old runs are with non-replicable data, therefore there is a performance difference. This emphasises the issue of the selection of negative.

- modify netzcore, netscore, netlink to adjust self edges and check performance change -> netzcore for biana no tap no reliability has 1.5% performance loss -> for now skiping all self edges

- adjusted confidence interval, (ROCR arised problems with adding fscore) to analyze_results.r script

- Tested linker degree (majority voting) with 1,2,5,10,11 as well as %20 %50 performance -> due to the nature of evaluation netlink t5 reversed achieves quite high performance -> is this due to negative score calculation? t1 is slightly better than random 

- Performance when no random non-seed selection is applied  (all negatives are included) is 15% better, this could be a more plausible option for demonstrating results however the PPV is devastatingly terrible.

- Performance of leave-one-out xval is not very different from 5 xval (1% less than xval5).

- Checked netrank with different pagerank iteration and without initial scores. Initial scores boosted performance (slightly in 20 iterations, a lot in 2 iterations) for goh network on alzheimer data with ~13 seeds (this is not significant, it has high variation). 20 is selected as the number of pagerank iterations and initial scores are used by default.

- runs for david's network: less number of seeds are fragile for performance comparision having very high variances, ns and nd seems to perform ok.

- Checked netscore r-i variation on goh network with aneurysm data. Performances are as follows r1i2 68, r1i3 68.9, r1i4 73, r2i2 74, r2i3 75.2, r2i4 80.1, r3i2 72, r3i3 76.2, r3i4 57.1. r2i3 may be used by default.

- fflow & nw & nb runs for goh/biana_no_tap on aneurysm & breast_cancer. Documented in the report for bo.

- Proofchecked netween & fflow 

- Checked goh aneurysm nz i4, ns r2i2 and r2i3 with different random seed assignment. Performances change similarly (all drop 2-4% when seed 5123 is used instead of 123). Also modified non-negative score calculation a bit so that all randoms are used -for sure- (previously the folds might not be covering all non-negatives but almost all)

- Using a different random sampling on nz on goh - aneurysm, has insignificant effect on the performance (<0.1%)

- A simple parameter check of baldo's method, iteration has little effect (which is superior compared to nz in terms of convergence, the reason could be score assignment if higher than some threshold), best performance is yielded when dn de 3 (vs 5), sigma 6 (vs 3),  max score 1 (vs 3 or 5) on goh aneurysm 66% (vs 75% of nz). 

- Modified PageRank to PageRank with priors (as used by Chen 09), performance increases by 8 to 20% on all data sets, but still <70%.

- Checked performance robustness of netscore to scaling for iterations, for r2i2 r2i3 goh aneurysm, neither scaling by iteration / sq(iteration) improves performance as well as scaling by iteration in addition to not scaling by number of messages. The behaviour may be different for larger iterations.

- Modified netzcore for consequitive runs. Added stddev for AUC, created a README file for AUC results

- accumulateToInitialScores flag has been set for scoring methods (in the test original seeds are not used anyway)

- For the network of biana_no_tap_relevance modified edge scores so that new_score = 1 + score (otherwise min score 0.01, max score 1 -> 100 times stronger edge, now at most 2 times stronger)

- Checked auc & recovery (check %10 coverages) rates for all runs. Also observed effects of parameters. In aneurysm on GOH and somewhat slightly in bc on BIANA, parameters have a considerable effect (probably due to number of seeds vs interactions). Apart from that, change of parameters around r2i2, r2i3, r3i2, r3i3 for Netscore, i4, i5, i6 for Netzcore and fFlow seems to have little effect. Selected parameters: r3i2 and i5. 

- For piana apoptosis network NetRank surprising performs as good as others (so does ns r1i1 -- need to see whether due to a speacial characteristic of network, e.g. seeds connected with each other)
