TODO:

- check the reason for performance difference between biana_no_top_no_reliability (even when the last modifications taken back)

- modify netzcore, netscore, netlink to adjust self edges and check performance change -> netzcore for biana no tap no reliability has 10% performance loss

- adding confidence interval, fscore and/or harmonic mean of sens spec to analyze_results.r script

- linker degree / majority voting (1,2,3 as well as %10 %25 %50) performance 

- check performance when no random non-seed selection is applied 

- check performance in leave-one-out xval (check first if scripts are capable of loo)

- comparison with other methods in the literature (with their data)
    - FunctionalFlow functional annotation (use scoreN with acc to initial scores option)
    - MetaCore topological score using shortest paths on psoriasis data
    - InfoFlow, lethality data on S. cervaise

- ml predictions based on feature described network (need to use the same training & test sets)

- aneurysm & breast cancer gene data from Osrisv2

- disease data from goh

- ppi network from jonsson 

- cancer data from futreal

- runs for possibly AES 

- check netscore i6 (for performace similarity to r2i3) on gaudi

- revert fflow to its original version

- check shortest path network inclusion count method implementation (check scores w/ original data)

- check netrank without initial scores

- modify netzcore for consequitive runs

- comparison of net* methods within pathologies on the effect of scoring & on the effect of different networks

- comparison of fflow with netzcore (with accumulateToInitialScores option)

- comparison of co-expression for correlation
    - Gemma
    - coexp network from stuart03
    - coexp network from 
    - from tissueinfo or p-values from HEFalMp with scores

- runs for possibly Hefalmp & OMIM data

- comparison of ppis from different species

- GO analysis on the high scoring nodes

- check performance on random seed assignment 

- document all

- filtering by localization (localization data from locate) (files from uri)

- incorporating additional info (active subnetwork discovery, structural info, etc)


NOTES:

- ns r2i3, r3i3, nz i5, n1 r3i3, nh r3i3, nd, nb i5 check 18 new protein scores & select high scoring proteins and GO analysis

- nz sucks when self score is assigned in case of 0 division (due to 0 variance), changed to assign inf/-inf. z-scoring in netzcore is contraversial, since it compares scores coming from different distributions (local neighborhood for each node), now assigning scores based on global distribution of neighboring scores.

- runs on 3 ppi with aneurysm data for preliminary analysis of programs & parameters

- Using random subsets of non-seed nodes to get negative score values (for calculating FP/TN). Was using subsets of 10 non-seeds, consequitive runs vary largely, now sampling usibng all non-seeds (N_nonseed / N_seed non_seeds are averaged for each non-negative fold)

- filtered networks with reliability scores (detection method + pubmed > 2) (can also use edge other attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- edge relevance scores coming from string (all vs only co-expression vs exp and db) (more data from tissue info / HEFalMp?) seem to not to improve performance

- using 0.00001 vs 0.01 as default non seed score reduced nz i5 performance on no_tap lcc by 4,5%

- performance with all initial network (not the largest connected component) is ~10% better than lcc ?-> small cc of 6,5,4,3,2 has quite good performances (e.g. all of these proteins in these cc's are associated - need to check)

- checked performance of ori's networks using gaudi: no significan difference using only network / network with coexp / network with coloc but 5% increase when using coexp + coloc also checked 1e-2 vs 1e-5 which yields only about 1% difference.

- checked how seeds are connected with each other (linker degree distribution and ratios of seeds), (see anaylze_network.r generated graphs) for biana_no_tap_no_reliability (ld>10/11 and rld2 > 60/65 % seems well seperator for some of the seeds
