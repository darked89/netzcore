TODO:

- adding fflow and baldo netzscore; need to change fflow so that seeds are not INF at the end, also it could incorporated using boost flow

- select r2i3 high scoring proteins and GO analysis

- document all

- add networks with reliability scores (using edge attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- add networks with co-expression data from tissue info, localization data from locate

- runs for possibly AES and then possibly Hefalmp & OMIM data

- runs on different networks (with diferent reliabilities) with different disease assoc. data and paramters and analysis

- comparison with other methods in the literature


NOTES:

- nz sucks when self score is assigned in case of 0 division (due to 0 variance), changed to assign inf/-inf. z-scoring in netzcore is contraversial, since it compares scores coming from different distributions (local neighborhood for each node), now assigning scores based on global distribution of neighboring scores.

- runs on 3 ppi with aneurysm data for preliminary analysis of programs & parameters
