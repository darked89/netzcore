TODO:

- runs on 3 ppi with aneurysm (and possibly AES and then possibly Hefalmp & OMIM) data for preliminary analysis of programs & parameters
biana
* ns
* nz

goh & rhodes
* ns
* nz
* nx
* nr

- document all

- add networks with reliability scores (using edge attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- runs on different networks (with diferent reliabilities) with different disease assoc. data and paramters and analysis
