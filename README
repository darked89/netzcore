TODO:

- start running netshort

- add drawROC to analyze

- runs on different networks (with diferent reliabilities) with different disease assoc. data and paramters and analysis

- document all

- add networks with reliability scores (using edge attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- ml predictions based on feature described network

- comparison with other methods in the literature
