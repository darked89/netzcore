TODO:

- document all

- check how seeds are connected with each other (linker degree distribution of seeds)

- modify netzcore for consequitive runs?

- filtering by localization (localization data from locate) (files from uri)

- breast cancer gene data from Osrisv2

- check performance on random seed assignment 

- ppi network from jonsson 

- cancer data from futreal

- runs for possibly AES and then possibly Hefalmp & OMIM data

- GO analysis on the high scoring nodes

- revert fflow to its original version

- check shortest path network inclusion count method implementation (check scores w/ original data)

- check netrank without initial scores

- incorporating additional info (active subnetwork discovery, structural info, etc)

- ml predictions based on feature described network

- comparison with other methods in the literature
    - FunctionalFlow
    - MetaCore topological score using shortest paths on psoriasis data
    - InfoFlow, lethality data on S. cervaise


NOTES:

- ns r2i3, r3i3, nz i5, n1 r3i3, nh r3i3, nd, nb i5 check 18 new protein scores & select high scoring proteins and GO analysis

- nz sucks when self score is assigned in case of 0 division (due to 0 variance), changed to assign inf/-inf. z-scoring in netzcore is contraversial, since it compares scores coming from different distributions (local neighborhood for each node), now assigning scores based on global distribution of neighboring scores.

- runs on 3 ppi with aneurysm data for preliminary analysis of programs & parameters

- Using random subsets of non-seed nodes to get negative score values (for calculating FP/TN). Was using subsets of 10 non-seeds, consequitive runs vary largely, now sampling usibng all non-seeds (N_nonseed / N_seed non_seeds are averaged for each non-negative fold)

- filtered networks with reliability scores (detection method + pubmed > 2) (can also use edge other attributes: pubmed, method, string coexpression/colocalization, jaccard, clustering coefficient)

- edge relevance scores coming from string (all vs only co-expression) (more data from tissue info can be used)
